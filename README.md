A collection of ideas and concepts for Molecule

## what is molecule?
Molecule is an independent text editor. Molecule is written in Dart and Flutter and therefore has an advantage over Electron based editors.

## the agony of choice
One of the first steps in creating Molecule is to decide on a language and an associated framework.

### python
Python as my home unfortunately offers very few (good) possibilities to write native applications. Even if you have found one, you still run into problems. Be it an immense package size (because you always have to have the virtual environment with you) or a certain sluggishness of the language.

### javascript and electron
no words for this. Even though I'm comfortable with web technologies, I don't think Molecule needs a whole browser attached. This also leads to enormous package sizes and ram loads.

### fooling around with c, c++ and even rust
I, for one, am not a fan of low-level languages. I will never really get used to it, I don't want to have to worry about things like memory management.

## Dart & Flutter - Light at the end of the tunnel
Dart & Flutter offer me exactly what I needed for Molecule. A fast, beautiful and modern user interface. Even though I feel a bit "suppressed" by Flutter (in the sense of little styling freedom), I like it a lot.
