# Molecule's competitors

The text editor market is very competitive, with VSCode largely dominating. 
To set up a competitive editor, the question is what makes the others stand out or do it well.
Here are my impressions of various editors.

## VSCode, Code OSS, VSCodium

VSCode is developed by Microsoft, which of course provides a solid development base. The "siblings" of VSCode VSCodium is actually just VSCode without the branding of Microsoft and without implementation of any Microsoft features. But both share a big problem. Electron.
Electron uses as much ram as a full browser, for my taste not what I expect from a text editor.

## Atom

Atom is developed by Github. But its development is going to an end in december 2022. It shares the same problem as VSCode since it also uses Electron as its base. 

## Lite-Xl

Lite-Xl is developed by a few people and they really do a great job. Lite-Xl is written in C and Lua and therefore really lightweighted. but i dont really like the user interface.

This list could go on forever, however I will end it here once.

# Conclusion

Molecule will be similar to Atom and VSCode in terms of design, but like Lite-Xl in terms of performance.
